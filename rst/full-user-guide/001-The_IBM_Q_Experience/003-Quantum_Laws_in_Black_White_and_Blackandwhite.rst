Quantum Laws in Black, White, and Blackandwhite
===============================================

Quantum laws are, as far as we know, the most fundamental physical
laws; they are inviolable. Here is our version of quantum physics
distilled into five key laws. If the mathematical concepts are new to you, just
print yourself a copy of these laws and skip them for now; while you
work through the rest of the tutorial, return to them every now and
then to see how they tie into what you are learning.

**Quantum is a system like everything else.**

To each physical system there corresponds a Hilbert space of
dimensionality equal to the system's maximum number of reliably
distinguishable states.  

**A quantum state is a configuration of the system.**

Each direction (ray) in the Hilbert space corresponds to a possible
state of the system  :math:`|\psi\rangle`, with two states being reliably distinguishable 
if and only if their directions are orthogonal :math:`\langle \phi|\psi\rangle =0` 
(inner product is zero).

**A quantum state changes; it naturally wants to evolve, but it can always be undone.**

Evolution of a closed system is a unitary transformation on its
Hilbert space.

**Scaling - how parts make a whole.**

The Hilbert space of a composite system is the tensor product of the Hilbert 
space of the parts.

**Quantum measurements are probabilistic.**

Each possible measurement on a system corresponds to a resolution
of its Hilbert space into orthogonal subspaces :math:`\{\Pi_j\}` where
:math:`\sum_j \Pi_j = 1`. On state :math:`|\psi\rangle` the result
:math:`j` occurs with probability :math:`P(j) = \langle \psi
|\Pi_j|\psi\rangle` and the state after the measurement is
:math:`|\psi_j\rangle = \Pi_j |\psi\rangle/\sqrt{P(j)}`.

These five principles are the foundation for the whole quantum world.
