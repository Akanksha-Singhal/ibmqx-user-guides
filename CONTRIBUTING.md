You can contribute in many ways to this project.


## Issue reporting

:fire: This is a goog point to start, when you find a problem please add it to the issue traker. The ideal report should include the steps to reproduce it.

If you find a typo or you're not sure if something is correct or not, open an issue and we will get back to you.


## Doubts solving

:two_women_holding_hands: To help less advanced users is another wonderful way to start. You can help us to close some opened issues. This kind of tickets should be labeled as `question`.


## Improvement proposal

:smiling_imp: If you have an idea for a new feature please open a ticket labeled as `enhancement`. If you could also add a piece of code with the idea or a partial implementation it would be awesome.


## Documentation

:eyes: We all know the doc always need fixes/upgrades :wink:, so please feel free to send a PR (see next point) with what you found.
