Advanced single qubit gates
===========================

Ok we are ready to hit the advance button. Go ahead and check the tick box. 
Doing this you should find that three orange gates :math:`\{U1,U2,U3` (and some 
more stuff we touch later) appear. These are the three physical single qubit 
gates of the IBM Q experience which take in one, two and three parameters respectively.
These are the main single qubit gates and the rest you have learnt about are 
just special cases. 

The phase gate. 

The U2 gate. 

The SU(2) gate. 

.. math:: 
  ~~~~~~~~T =\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\pi/4} \end{pmatrix}
